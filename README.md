Here are some abstracts/summarys of talks I've made or given

## Machine Learning

### Machine Learning: Understanding and building Neural Networks from Scratch

If there's one area in tech that's made huge growth in 2017, it's Machine Learning. Instead of using explicit code to solve problems, ML aims to let the data solve them for you. With all this hype, do we *really* understand what's going on under the hood? This hands-on session will give attendees the tools and concepts needed to write your very own Neural Networks! Topics that will be covered include Matrices, Neurons, Gradient Descent, Loss Functions, Activation Functions, and Back Propagation. Attendees will leave with the ability to not just build their own Machine Learning models, but also dig deeper into the data and customize their approach per project.

### Hello World: Machine Learning in Under an Hour with TensorFlow and Keras

With all the hype right now around Machine Learning and AI, it's easy to become confused on how and where to get started. Do you focus on the math, or the frameworks, or the problems? This session will teach attendees what Machine Learning is (and what it's not) and how to get started with TensorFlow/Keras. Attendees will leave having seen a practical example of how to predict handwritten numbers and the knowledge that Machine Learning is approachable and fun.

### Structuring a Real World Machine Learning Project

So you've learned what Machine Learning is, you've done the Hello World projects, now how do you get your boss to let you use it at work? This talk will cover some example business problems that Machine Learning can be great at solving, how to pitch it to your boss, then how one would go about starting a project with production in mind. Attendees will leave with knowledge of the practicality of using Machine Learning at work, how to go about convincing stakeholders, and how to design and structure your Machine Learning project.

### Machine Learning: Taking your ML Models to Android and iOS

Once you've developed a kickass Machine Learning model, you need a way to get that model to your computing devices (phones) to start doing your predictions! Most Machine Learning projects in production will 'train' the model on cloud servers, then 'deploy' the model to an API server or mobile device. This session will introduce the attendee on using TensorFlow Serving and Apple CoreML to deploy Machine Learning models to a mobile app.


## DevOps

### Intro to Docker

Want to learn how to have the exact same environment locally as is in production?  Docker is an open source tool to organize Linux containers.  A container is a sandbox environment that runs a collection of processes. Containers are light-weight VMs that share the same kernel as the host OS.  This session will teach attendees the concept of containers, the pros and cons, plus how to get up and running on your machine.

### Dial Up Your Flow

Crank out more bits for the web with automation tools. Learn how to speed up your development process, automate different processes most developers do already, and leverage your build cycle to save time.  We'll use a combination of tools to accomplish this with tools like npm, gulp, broswersync, yeoman, and more!

### Ron Popeil Never Had It So Good

Is your whole team spending a day each getting local environments ready to start work?  Are you a web developer with hundreds of active clients and build each VPS by hand?  It's time you learned how to leverage DevOps to automate as much work as possible!  Attendees will learn about the concept of DevOps, popular tools, and how to get started.  We'll talk about tools like Chef, Puppet, and Vagrant.
